Here we use genomes from the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP),
downloaded from the Drosophila Genome Nexus (http://www.johnpool.net/genomes.html) in October 2015.
From that page:

>  The D. melanogaster genomes aligned here are from the following sources:
>  Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP)
>     Phase 1 - Malawi extraction lines only (Langley et al. 2012 Genetics)
>     Phase 2 - Most from a variety of African populations (Pool et al. 2012 PLoS Genetics)
>     Phase 3 - Nearly 200 genomes from a single high diversity and low admixture Zambia  
>                      population (unpublished, sequenced by the Langley lab)
>  Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) - ~200 genomes from a North American  
>     sample (Mackay et al. 2012 Nature)
>  Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) - parental strain genomes
>  Additional African genomes sequenced by the Pool lab
>  
>  Information regarding the populations of origin is here:  [POPULATION SPREADSHEET](populations.xls).
>  
>  A summary of the individual genomes is here:  [INDIVIDUAL SPREADSHEET](individuals.csv).  Included are depth, coverage, read characteristics, and chromosomal representation.  Each genome's origin from inbred, isofemale, or homozygous chromosome line adults, or else a haploid embryo (Langley et al. 2011 Genetics), is also noted.
