The geographic distribution of synthetic variables can be plotted by the same technique used in mapping the gene frequency of a single allele. Synthetic maps were constructed for Europe and the Near East, with the use of principal components to condense the information of 38 independent alleles from ten loci. The first principal component summarizes close to 30\% of the total information and shows gradients. Maps thus constructed show clines in remarkable agreement with those expected on the basis of the spread of early farming in Europe, thus supporting the hypothesis that this spread was a demic spread rather than a cultural diffusion of farming technology.},

We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like $F_{ST}$) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

  abstract = {Technological and scientific advances, stemming in large part from the Human Genome and HapMap projects, have made large-scale, genome-wide investigations feasible and cost effective. These advances have the potential to dramatically impact drug discovery and development by identifying genetic factors that contribute to variation in disease risk as well as drug pharmacokinetics, treatment efficacy, and adverse drug reactions. In spite of the technological advancements, successful application in biomedical research would be limited without access to suitable sample collections. To facilitate exploratory genetics research, we have assembled a DNA resource from a large number of subjects participating in multiple studies throughout the world. This growing resource was initially genotyped with a commercially available genome-wide 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism panel. This project includes nearly 6,000 subjects of African-American, East Asian, South Asian, Mexican, and European origin. Seven informative axes of variation identified via principal-component analysis (PCA) of these data confirm the overall integrity of the data and highlight important features of the genetic structure of diverse populations. The potential value of such extensively genotyped collections is illustrated by selection of genetically matched population controls in a genome-wide analysis of abacavir-associated hypersensitivity reaction. We find that matching based on country of origin, identity-by-state distance, and multidimensional PCA do similarly well to control the type I error rate. The genotype and demographic data from this reference sample are freely available through the NCBI database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).},

  abstract = {Despite the significant advances made over the last few years in mapping inversions with the advent of paired-end sequencing approaches, our understanding of the prevalence and spectrum of inversions in the human genome has lagged behind other types of structural variants, mainly due to the lack of a cost-efficient method applicable to large-scale samples. We propose a novel method based on principal components analysis (PCA) to characterize inversion polymorphisms using high-density SNP genotype data. Our method applies to non-recurrent inversions for which recombination between the inverted and non-inverted segments in inversion heterozygotes is suppressed due to the loss of unbalanced gametes. Inside such an inversion region, an effect similar to population substructure is thus created: two distinct "populations" of inversion homozygotes of different orientations and their 1:1 admixture, namely the inversion heterozygotes. This kind of substructure can be readily detected by performing PCA locally in the inversion regions. Using simulations, we demonstrated that the proposed method can be used to detect and genotype inversion polymorphisms using unphased genotype data. We applied our method to the phase III HapMap data and inferred the inversion genotypes of known inversion polymorphisms at 8p23.1 and 17q21.31. These inversion genotypes were validated by comparing with literature results and by checking Mendelian consistency using the family data whenever available. Based on the PCA-approach, we also performed a preliminary genome-wide scan for inversions using the HapMap data, which resulted in 2040 candidate inversions, 169 of which overlapped with previously reported inversions. Our method can be readily applied to the abundant SNP data, and is expected to play an important role in developing human genome maps of inversions and exploring associations between inversions and susceptibility of diseases.},

studies, which arises principally because of population structure and cryptic
relatedness. Many treatments of the problem consider only a simple “island”
model of population structure. We take a broader approach, which views pop-
ulation structure and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a single con-
founder: the unobserved pedigree defining the (often distant) relationships
among the study subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and we re-
view methods of defining and estimating kinship coefficients, both pedigree-
based and marker-based. In this unified framework we review solutions to
the problem of population structure, including family-based study designs,
genomic control, structured association, regression control, principal compo-
nents adjustment and linear mixed models. The last solution makes the most
explicit use of the kinships among the study subjects, and has an established
role in the analysis of animal and plant breeding studies. Recent computa-
tional developments mean that analyses of human genetic association data
are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for association, which pro-
tect against population structure and cryptic kinship, as well as intermediate
levels of confounding by the pedigree.},

@article{bierne2010distinctive,
  abstract = {Loci with higher levels of population differentiation than the neutral expectation are traditionally interpreted as evidence of ongoing selection that varies in space. This article emphasizes an alternative explanation that has been largely overlooked to date: in species subdivided into large subpopulations, enhanced differentiation can also be the signature left by the fixation of an unconditionally favorable mutation on its chromosomal neighborhood. This is because the hitchhiking effect is expected to diminish as the favorable mutation spreads from the deme in which it originated to other demes. To discriminate among the two alternative scenarios one needs to investigate how genetic structure varies along the chromosomal region of the locus. Local hitchhiking is shown to generate a single sharp peak of differentiation centered on the adaptive polymorphism and the standard signature of a selective sweep only in those subpopulations in which the allele is favored. Global hitchhiking produces two domes of differentiation on either side of the fixed advantageous mutation and signatures of a selective sweep in every subpopulation, albeit of different magnitude. Investigating population differentiation around a locus that strongly differentiates two otherwise genetically similar populations of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis, plausible evidence for the global hitchhiking hypothesis has been obtained. Global hitchhiking is a neglected phenomenon that might prove to be important in species with large population sizes such as many marine invertebrates.},

We show that the explicit modeling of the allele frequency allows individuals to be localized on the map on the basis of their genetic information alone. We apply our SPA method to a European and a worldwide population genetic variation data set and identify SNPs showing large gradients in allele frequency, and we suggest these as candidate regions under selection.

We consider the effects of geographic structure on variation within and between local populations, first in general terms, and then for specific migration models. We discuss the close parallels between geographic structure and stable types of genetic structure caused by selection, including balancing selection and background selection. The effects of departures from stability, such as selective sweeps and population bottlenecks, are also described. Methods for distinguishing population history from the effects of ongoing gene flow are discussed. We relate the theoretical results to observed patterns of variation in natural populations.},

This study allowed a clearer ascertainment of differences that could not be discerned in smaller studies using more limited numbers of DNA variations. We show clear differences among European American participants of different self-identified ethnic affiliation. The analyses showed multiple components of variation. The components showing the largest variations generally corresponded to the grandparental country or region of origin within Europe. We also show the importance of applying this information in determining genetic risk factors for complex diseases.

@article{barton2000genetic,
  abstract = {Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes, even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking, concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 + E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of neutral alleles.},

@article{kim2011hitchhiking,
  abstract = {A central problem in population genetics is to detect and analyze positive natural selection by which beneficial mutations are driven to fixation. The hitchhiking effect of a rapidly spreading beneficial mutation, which results in local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population, which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. This raises a possibility of detecting a "hidden" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.},

@article{petkova2014visualizing,
  abstract = {Genetic data often exhibit patterns that are broadly consistent with "isolation by distance" - a phenomenon where genetic similarity tends to decay with geographic distance. In a heterogeneous habitat, decay may occur more quickly in some regions than others: for example, barriers to gene flow can accelerate the genetic differentiation between groups located close in space. We use the concept of "effective migration" to model the relationship between genetics and geography: in this paradigm, effective migration is low in regions where genetic similarity decays quickly. We present a method to quantify and visualize variation in effective migration across the habitat, which can be used to identify potential barriers to gene flow, from geographically indexed large-scale genetic data. Our approach uses a population genetic model to relate underlying migration rates to expected pairwise genetic dissimilarities, and estimates migration rates by matching these expectations to the observed dissimilarities. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our method using simulations and data from elephant, human, and Arabidopsis thaliana populations.  The resulting visualizations highlight important features of the spatial population structure that are difficult to discern using existing methods for summarizing genetic variation such as principal components analysis.Received November 25, 2014.Accepted November 26, 2014. 2014, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressThis pre-print is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International), CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/},

@article{duforetfrebourg2015detecting,
  abstract = {To characterize natural selection, various analytical methods for detecting candidate genomic regions have been developed. We propose to perform genome-wide scans of natural selection using principal component analysis (PCA). We show that the common FST index of genetic differentiation between populations can be viewed as the proportion of variance explained by the principal components. Considering the correlations between genetic variants and each principal component provides a conceptual framework to detect genetic variants involved in local adaptation without any prior definition of populations. To validate the PCA-based approach, we consider the 1000 Genomes data (phase 1) considering 850 individuals coming from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The number of genetic variants is of the order of 36 millions obtained with a low-coverage sequencing depth (3×). The correlations between genetic variation and each principal component provide well-known targets for positive selection (EDAR, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, DARC), and also new candidate genes (APPBPP2, TP1A1, RTTN, KCNMA, MYO5C) and noncoding RNAs. In addition to identifying genes involved in biological adaptation, we identify two biological pathways involved in polygenic adaptation that are related to the innate immune system (beta defensins) and to lipid metabolism (fatty acid omega oxidation). An additional analysis of European data shows that a genome scan based on PCA retrieves classical examples of local adaptation even when there are no well-defined populations. PCA-based statistics, implemented in the PCAdapt R package and the PCAdapt fast open-source software, retrieve well-known signals of human adaptation, which is encouraging for future whole-genome sequencing project, especially when defining populations is difficult.},

@article{falush2003inference,
  abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

@article{ramachandran2005support,
  abstract = {Equilibrium models of isolation by distance predict an increase in genetic differentiation with geographic distance. Here we find a linear relationship between genetic and geographic distance in a worldwide sample of human populations, with major deviations from the fitted line explicable by admixture or extreme isolation. A close relationship is shown to exist between the correlation of geographic distance and genetic differentiation (as measured by F
                  ST) and the geographic pattern of heterozygosity across populations. Considering a worldwide set of geographic locations as possible sources of the human expansion, we find that heterozygosities in the globally distributed populations of the data set are best explained by an expansion originating in Africa and that no geographic origin outside of Africa accounts as well for the observed patterns of genetic diversity. Although the relationship between F
                  ST and geographic distance has been interpreted in the past as the result of an equilibrium model of drift and dispersal, simulation shows that the geographic pattern of heterozygosities in this data set is consistent with a model of a serial founder effect starting at a single origin. Given this serial-founder scenario, the relationship between genetic and geographic distance allows us to derive bounds for the effects of drift and natural selection on human genetic variation.},

While it has long been appreciated that such selective sweeps influence the frequency spectrum of nearby polymorphism, it has only recently become clear that they also have dramatic effects on local linkage disequilibrium. By extending previous results on the relationship between genealogical structure and linkage disequilibrium, I obtain simple expressions for the influence of a selective sweep on patterns of allelic association. I show that sweeps can increase, decrease, or even eliminate linkage disequilibrium (LD) entirely depending on the relative position of the selected and neutral loci. I also show the importance of the age of the neutral mutations in predicting their degree of association and describe the consequences of such results for the interpretation of empirical data. In particular, I demonstrate that while selective sweeps can eliminate LD, they generate patterns of genetic variation very different from those expected from recombination hotspots.},

  abstract = {Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular evolution saw little connection between natural selection and genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies rely upon segregating natural genetic variation, particularly the patterns of polymorphism and correlation between adjacent markers. To facilitate association studies in the model legume Medicago truncatula, we present a genome-scale polymorphism scan using existing Affymetrix microarrays. We develop and validate a method that uses a simple information-criteria algorithm to call polymorphism from microarray data without reliance on a reference genotype. We genotype 12 inbred M. truncatula lines sampled from four wild Tunisian populations and find polymorphisms at approximately 7% of features, comprising 31 419 probes. Only approximately 3% of these markers assort by population, and of these only 10% differentiate between populations from saline and non-saline sites. Fifty-two differentiated probes with unique genome locations correspond to 18 distinct genome regions. Sanger resequencing was used to characterize a subset of maker loci and develop a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing assay that confirmed marker assortment by habitat in an independent sample of 33 individuals from the four populations. Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) extends on average for approximately 10 kb, falling to background levels by approximately 500 kb. A similar range of LD decay was observed in the 18 genome regions that assort by habitat; these LD blocks delimit candidate genes for local adaptation, many of which encode proteins with predicted functions in abiotic stress tolerance and are targets for functional genomic studies. Tunisian M. truncatula populations contain substantial amounts of genetic variation that is structured in relatively small LD blocks, suggesting a history of migration and recombination. These populations provide a strong resource for genome-wide association studies.},

  abstract = {There has been an enormous increase in the amount of data on DNA sequence polymorphism available for many organisms in the last decade. New sequencing technologies provide great potential for investigating natural selection in plants using population genomic approaches. However, plant populations frequently show significant departures from the assumptions of standard models used to detect selection and many forms of directional selection do not fit with classical population genetics theory. Here, we explore the extent to which plant populations show departures from standard model assumptions, and the implications this has for detecting selection on molecular variation. A growing number of multilocus studies of nucleotide variation suggest that changes in population size, particularly bottlenecks, and strong subdivision may be common in plants. This demographic variation presents important challenges for models used to infer selection. In addition, selection from standing genetic variation and multiple independent adaptive substitutions can further complicate efforts to understand the nature of selection. We discuss emerging patterns from plant studies and propose that, rather than treating population history as a nuisance variable when testing for selection, the interaction between demography and selection is of fundamental importance for evolutionary studies of plant populations using molecular data.},

@article{kaplan1989hitchhiking,
  abstract = {The number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes can be affected by ancestral selectively favored substitutions at linked loci. The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

@article{kim2004linkage,
  abstract = {The hitchhiking effect of a beneficial mutation, or a selective sweep, generates a unique distribution of allele frequencies and spatial distribution of polymorphic sites. A composite-likelihood test was previously designed to detect these signatures of a selective sweep, solely on the basis of the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms. As an excess of linkage disequilibrium (LD) is also known to be a strong signature of a selective sweep, we investigate how much statistical power is increased by the inclusion of information regarding LD. The expected pattern of LD is predicted by a genealogical approach. Both theory and simulation suggest that strong LD is generated in narrow regions at both sides of the location of beneficial mutation. However, a lack of LD is expected across the two sides. We explore various ways to detect this signature of selective sweeps by statistical tests. A new composite-likelihood method is proposed to incorporate information regarding LD. This method enables us to detect selective sweeps and estimate the parameters of the selection model better than the previous composite-likelihood method that does not take LD into account. However, the improvement made by including LD is rather small, suggesting that most of the relevant information regarding selective sweeps is captured by the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms.},

Growing the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in field experiments in four sites across the species’ native range, we identified candidate loci for local adaptation from a genome-wide association study of lifetime fitness in geographically diverse accessions. Fitness-associated loci exhibited both geographic and climatic signatures of local adaptation. Relative to genomic controls, high-fitness alleles were generally distributed closer to the site where they increased fitness, occupying specific and distinct climate spaces. Independent loci with different molecular functions contributed most strongly to fitness variation in each site. Independent local adaptation by distinct genetic mechanisms may facilitate a flexible evolutionary response to changing environment across a species range.},

To date, analyses of the natural genetic variation of A. thaliana have involved small numbers of individual plants or genetic markers. Here we genotype 1,307 worldwide accessions, including several regional samples, using a 250K SNP chip. This allowed us to produce a high-resolution description of the global pattern of genetic variation. We applied three complementary selection tests and identified new targets of selection. Further, we characterized the pattern of historical recombination in A. thaliana and observed an enrichment of hotspots in its intergenic regions and repetitive DNA, which is consistent with the pattern that is observed for humans but which is strikingly different from that observed in other plant species. We have made the seeds we used to produce this Regional Mapping (RegMap) panel publicly available.

@article{vandermaaten2009dimensionality,
  abstract = {In recent years, a variety of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have been
proposed that aim to address the limitations of traditional techniques such as PCA
and classical scaling. The paper presents a review and systematic comparison of
these techniques. The performances of the nonlinear techniques are investigated on
artificial and natural tasks. The results of the experiments reveal that nonlinear tech-
niques perform well on selected artificial tasks, but that this strong performance does
not necessarily extend to real-world tasks. The paper explains these results by identi-
fying weaknesses of current nonlinear techniques, and suggests how the performance
of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques may be improved.

Real-world data, such as speech signals, digital photographs, or fMRI scans, usually has a high dimen-
sionality. In order to handle such real-world data adequately, its dimensionality needs to be reduced.
Dimensionality reduction is the transformation of high-dimensional data into a meaningful representa-
tion of reduced dimensionality. Ideally, the reduced representation should have a dimensionality that
corresponds to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. The intrinsic dimensionality of data is the mini-
mum number of parameters needed to account for the observed properties of the data [49]. Dimension-
ality reduction is important in many domains, since it mitigates the curse of dimensionality and other
undesired properties of high-dimensional spaces [69]. As a result, dimensionality reduction facilitates,
among others, classification, visualization, and compression of high-dimensional data. Traditionally, di-
mensionality reduction was performed using linear techniques such as Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) [98], factor analysis [117], and classical scaling [126]. However, these linear techniques cannot
adequately handle complex nonlinear data.
In the last decade, a large number of nonlinear techniques for dimensionality reduction have been
proposed. See for an overview, e.g., [26, 110, 83, 131]. In contrast to the traditional linear techniques,
the nonlinear techniques have the ability to deal with complex nonlinear data. In particular for real-
world data, the nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques may offer an advantage, because real-
world data is likely to form a highly nonlinear manifold. Previous studies have shown that nonlinear
techniques outperform their linear counterparts on complex artificial tasks. For instance, the Swiss roll
dataset comprises a set of points that lie on a spiral-like two-dimensional manifold that is embedded
within a three-dimensional space. A vast number of nonlinear techniques are perfectly able to find this
embedding, whereas linear techniques fail to do so. In contrast to these successes on artificial datasets,
successful applications of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques on natural datasets are less
convincing. Beyond this observation, it is not clear to what extent the performances of the various
dimensionality reduction techniques differ on artificial and natural tasks (a comparison is performed in
[94], but this comparison is very limited in scope with respect to the number of techniques and tasks
that are addressed).
Motivated by the lack of a systematic comparison of dimensionality reduction techniques, this paper
presents a comparative study of the most important linear dimensionality reduction technique (PCA),
and twelve frontranked nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. The aims of the paper are (1)
to investigate to what extent novel nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques outperform the tradi-
tional PCA on real-world datasets and (2) to identify the inherent weaknesses of the twelve nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. The investigation is performed by both a theoretical and an empir-
ical evaluation of the dimensionality reduction techniques. The identification is performed by a careful
analysis of the empirical results on specifically designed artificial datasets and on a selection of real-
world datasets.
Next to PCA, the paper investigates the following twelve nonlinear techniques: (1) Kernel PCA,
(2) Isomap, (3) Maximum Variance Unfolding, (4) diffusion maps, (5) Locally Linear Embedding,
(6) Laplacian Eigenmaps, (7) Hessian LLE, (8) Local Tangent Space Analysis, (9) Sammon mapping,
(10) multilayer autoencoders, (11) Locally Linear Coordination, and (12) manifold charting.},

  abstract = {In Drosophila, multiple lines of evidence converge in suggesting that beneficial substitutions to the genome may be common. All suffer from confounding factors, however, such that the interpretation of the evidence-in particular, conclusions about the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D. simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately 3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and illustrate how the rapidly accumulating genome-wide data can be leveraged to address enduring questions about the genetic basis of adaptation.},

@article{pease2013accurate,
  abstract = {When speciation events occur in rapid succession, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) can cause disagreement among individual gene trees. The probability that ILS affects a given locus is directly related to its effective population size (Ne ), which in turn is proportional to the recombination rate if there is strong selection across the genome. Based on these expectations, we hypothesized that low-recombination regions of the genome, as well as sex chromosomes and nonrecombining chromosomes, should exhibit lower levels of ILS. We tested this hypothesis in phylogenomic datasets from primates, the Drosophila melanogaster clade, and the Drosophila simulans clade. In all three cases, regions of the genome with low or no recombination showed significantly stronger support for the putative species tree, although results from the X chromosome differed among clades. Our results suggest that recurrent selection is acting in these low-recombination regions, such that current levels of diversity also reflect past decreases in the effective population size at these same loci. The results also demonstrate how considering the genomic context of a gene tree can assist in more accurate determination of the true species phylogeny, especially in cases where a whole-genome phylogeny appears to be an unresolvable polytomy.},

  abstract = {North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster derive from both European and African source populations, but despite their importance for genetic research, patterns of ancestry along their genomes are largely undocumented. Here, I infer geographic ancestry along genomes of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and the D. melanogaster reference genome, which may have implications for reference alignment, association mapping, and population genomic studies in Drosophila. Overall, the proportion of African ancestry was estimated to be 20% for the DGRP and 9% for the reference genome. Combining my estimate of admixture timing with historical records, I provide the first estimate of natural generation time for this species (approximately 15 generations per year). Ancestry levels were found to vary strikingly across the genome, with less African introgression on the X chromosome, in regions of high recombination, and at genes involved in specific processes (e.g., circadian rhythm). An important role for natural selection during the admixture process was further supported by evidence that many unlinked pairs of loci showed a deficiency of Africa–Europe allele combinations between them. Numerous epistatic fitness interactions may therefore exist between African and European genotypes, leading to ongoing selection against incompatible variants. By focusing on hubs in this network of fitness interactions, I identified a set of interacting loci that include genes with roles in sensation and neuropeptide/hormone reception. These findings suggest that admixed D. melanogaster samples could become an important study system for the genetics of early-stage isolation between populations.},

  abstract = {Heliconius butterflies represent a recent radiation of species, in which wing pattern divergence has been implicated in speciation. Several loci that control wing pattern phenotypes have been mapped and two were identified through sequencing. These same gene regions play a role in adaptation across the whole Heliconius radiation. Previous studies of population genetic patterns at these regions have sequenced small amplicons. Here, we use targeted next-generation sequence capture to survey patterns of divergence across these entire regions in divergent geographical races and species of Heliconius. This technique was successful both within and between species for obtaining high coverage of almost all coding regions and sufficient coverage of non-coding regions to perform population genetic analyses. We find major peaks of elevated population differentiation between races across hybrid zones, which indicate regions under strong divergent selection. These 'islands' of divergence appear to be more extensive between closely related species, but there is less clear evidence for such islands between more distantly related species at two further points along the 'speciation continuum'. We also sequence fosmid clones across these regions in different Heliconius melpomene races. We find no major structural rearrangements but many relatively large (greater than 1 kb) insertion/deletion events (including gain/loss of transposable elements) that are variable between races.},

is key to understanding speciation1. The naturally hybridizing col-
lared flycatcher and pied flycatcher are important avian speciation
models2–7 that show pre- as well as postzygotic isolation8,9. We
sequenced and assembled the 1.1-Gb flycatcher genome, physically
mapped the assembly to chromosomes using a low-density linkage
map10 and re-sequenced population samples of each species. Here
we show that the genomic landscape of species differentiation is
highly heterogeneous with approximately 50 ‘divergence islands’
showing up to 50-fold higher sequence divergence than the geno-
mic background. These non-randomly distributed islands, with
between one and three regions of elevated divergence per chro-
mosome irrespective of chromosome size, are characterized by
reduced levels of nucleotide diversity, skewed allele-frequency
spectra, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium and reduced pro-
portions of shared polymorphisms in both species, indicative of
parallel episodes of selection. Proximity of divergence peaks
to genomic regions resistant to sequence assembly, potentially
including centromeres and telomeres, indicate that complex repeat
structures may drive species divergence. A much higher back-
ground level of species divergence of the Z chromosome, and
a lower proportion of shared polymorphisms, indicate that sex
chromosomes and autosomes are at different stages of speciation.
This study provides a roadmap to the emerging field of speciation

understand how evolutionary processes shape genetic diversity. Most population
genetic inference is based on frameworks assuming adaptive evolution is rare.
But if positive selection operates on many loci simultaneously, as has recently
been suggested for many species including animals such as flies, a different
approach is necessary. In this review, I discuss recent progress in
characterizing and understanding evolution in rapidly adapting populations
where random associations of mutations with genetic backgrounds of different
fitness, i.e., genetic draft, dominate over genetic drift. As a result, neutral
genetic diversity depends weakly on population size, but strongly on the rate
of adaptation or more generally the variance in fitness. Coalescent processes
with multiple mergers, rather than Kingman's coalescent, are appropriate
genealogical models for rapidly adapting populations with important

@article{charlesworth2012effects,
  abstract = {The process of evolution at a given site in the genome can be influenced by the action of selection at other sites, especially when these are closely linked to it. Such selection reduces the effective population size experienced by the site in question (the Hill-Robertson effect), reducing the level of variability and the efficacy of selection. In particular, deleterious variants are continually being produced by mutation and then eliminated by selection at sites throughout the genome. The resulting reduction in variability at linked neutral or nearly neutral sites can be predicted from the theory of background selection, which assumes that deleterious mutations have such large effects that their behavior in the population is effectively deterministic. More weakly selected mutations can accumulate by Muller's ratchet after a shutdown of recombination, as in an evolving Y chromosome. Many functionally significant sites are probably so weakly selected that Hill-Robertson interference undermines the effective strength of selection upon them, when recombination is rare or absent. This leads to large departures from deterministic equilibrium and smaller effects on linked neutral sites than under background selection or Muller's ratchet. Evidence is discussed that is consistent with the action of these processes in shaping genome-wide patterns of variation and evolution.},

@article{coop2012patterns,
  abstract = {Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently available.},

In the case of a single strongly selected substitution, expected heterozygosity at a linked neutral locus is reduced by a factor (2cs)α−2csΓ(−2cs), 1α), where s is the selective advantage of the favored allele, c is the recombination fraction between the neutral and selected locus, and α = 2Ns, with N as the diploid population size. Γ denotes the incomplete gamma function. Using this result and assuming that at any one time at most one substitution is on its way to fixation, the effect of recurrent selected substitutions on expected heterozygosity can be approximated by 1[1−α(vϱ)λ(1α, − 2Ms)], where ν and ϱ are the expected numbers of selected substitutions and crossovers, respectively, per chromosome, per nucleotide, per generation, and M is the maximal recombination distance from the neutral locus that a selected mutation can be and still have a hitchhiking effect on the neutral locus.

  abstract = {Considerable interest is focused on the use of polymorphism data to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation. Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a loss of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the signature of directional selection currently relied on by researchers. These findings highlight the importance of an accurate characterization of the effects of positive selection, if we are to reliably identify recent adaptations from polymorphism data.},

  abstract = {Adaptation is often thought to leave the signature of a hard selective sweep,
in which a single haplotype bearing the beneficial allele reaches high
population frequency. However, an alternative and often-overlooked scenario is
that of a soft selective sweep, in which multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep
through the population simultaneously. Soft selective sweeps are likely either
when adaptation proceeds from standing genetic variation or in large
populations where adaptation is not mutation-limited. Current statistical
methods are not well designed to test for soft sweeps, and thus are likely to
miss these possibly numerous adaptive events because they look for
characteristic reductions in heterozygosity. Here, we developed a statistical
test based on a haplotype statistic, H12, capable of detecting both hard and
soft sweeps with similar power. We used H12 to identify multiple genomic
regions that have undergone recent and strong adaptation using a population
sample of fully sequenced Drosophila melanogaster strains (DGRP). We then
developed a second statistical test based on a statistic H2/H1 | H12, to test
whether a given selective sweep detected by H12 is hard or soft. Surprisingly,
when applying the test based on H2/H1 | H12 to the top 50 most extreme H12
candidates in the DGRP data, we reject the hard sweep hypothesis in every case.
In contrast, all 50 cases show strong support (Bayes Factor >10) for a soft
sweep model. Our results suggest that recent adaptation in North American
populations of D. melanogaster has led primarily to soft sweeps either because
it utilized standing genetic variation or because the short-term effective
population size in D. melanogaster is on the order of billions or larger.},

@article{gao2014footprints,
  abstract = {When long-lived, balancing selection can lead to trans-species polymorphisms
that are shared by two or more species identical by descent. In this case, the
gene genealogies at the selected sites cluster by allele instead of by species
and, because of linkage, nearby neutral sites also have unusual genealogies.
Although it is clear that this scenario should lead to discernible footprints
in genetic variation data, notably the presence of additional neutral
polymorphisms shared between species and the absence of fixed differences, the
effects remain poorly characterized. We focus on the case of a single site
under long-lived balancing selection and derive approximations for summaries of
the data that are sensitive to a trans-species polymorphism: the length of the
segment that carries most of the signals, the expected number of shared neutral
SNPs within the segment and the patterns of allelic associations among them.
Coalescent simulations of ancient balancing selection confirm the accuracy of
our approximations. We further show that for humans and chimpanzees, and more
generally for pairs of species with low genetic diversity levels, the patterns

@article{engelhardt2010analysis,
  abstract = {We consider the statistical analysis of population structure using genetic data. We show how the two most widely used approaches to modeling population structure, admixture-based models and principal components analysis (PCA), can be viewed within a single unifying framework of matrix factorization. Specifically, they can both be interpreted as approximating an observed genotype matrix by a product of two lower-rank matrices, but with different constraints or prior distributions on these lower-rank matrices. This opens the door to a large range of possible approaches to analyzing population structure, by considering other constraints or priors. In this paper, we introduce one such novel approach, based on sparse factor analysis (SFA). We investigate the effects of the different types of constraint in several real and simulated data sets. We find that SFA produces similar results to admixture-based models when the samples are descended from a few well-differentiated ancestral populations and can recapitulate the results of PCA when the population structure is more "continuous," as in isolation-by-distance models.},

Two populations that are sampled at distant locations but that are genetically similar (perhaps one was recently founded by a colonization event from the other) may have inferred locations that are nearby, while two populations that are sampled close together, but that are genetically dissimilar (e.g., are separated by a barrier), may have inferred locations that are farther apart. The result is a “geogenetic” map in which the distances between populations are effective distances, indicative of the way that populations perceive the distances between themselves: the “organism’s-eye view” of the world. Added to this, “admixture” can be thought of as the outcome of unusually long-distance gene flow; it results in relatedness between populations that is anomalously high given the distance that separates them. We depict the effect of admixture using arrows, from a source of admixture to its target, on the inferred map. The inferred geogenetic map is an intuitive and information-rich visual summary of patterns of population structure.</p>},

  abstract = {In general, individuals who survive to reproduce have genotypes that work relatively well under local conditions. Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

IBE represents one of the most important patterns that results from the ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences gene flow and population connectivity, but it has only recently been examined in studies of ecological and landscape genetics. Nevertheless, the study of IBE presents valuable opportunities to investigate how spatial heterogeneity in ecological processes, agents of selection and environmental variables contributes to genetic divergence in nature. New and increasingly sophisticated studies of IBE in natural systems are poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the role of ecology in genetic divergence and of modes of differentiation both within and between species. Here, we describe the underlying ecological processes that can generate patterns of IBE, examine its implications for a wide variety of disciplines and outline several areas of future research that can answer pressing questions about the ecological basis of genetic diversity.},

He suggested then, and later proved, that they have a dramatic effect on transmission: when heterozygous, inversions suppress recombination. Over the next half century, inspired largely by Dobzhansky and his coworkers, much of empirical population genetics devoted itself to studying the abundant polymorphisms within and fixed differences of inversions between species of Drosophila [2]. Starting in the 1970s, this rich literature largely sank from view with the rise of biochemical and then molecular genetics. But inversions are ascendant again. Comparative genomics is now revealing that chromosomes are far more structurally fluid than even Dobzhansky dared to suppose. Where classic cytogenetics identified only nine inversions that distinguish humans and chimpanzees, comparison of their genomic sequences reveals on the order of 1,500 [3] (Figure 1). Despite the importance of inversions as a major mechanism for reorganizing the genome, we are still struggling to understand how and why they evolve almost a century after Sturtevant's discovery.},

These processes can generate the diversity necessary for novel adaptations and continued diversification of taxa. Previous research has suggested that not all regions of a genome are equally permeable to introgression. We have conducted one of the first genome-wide assessments of patterns of reciprocal introgression in plant populations. We found evidence that suggests domesticated maize received adaptation to highland conditions from a wild relative, teosinte, during its spread to the high elevations of central Mexico. Gene flow appeared asymmetric, favoring teosinte introgression into maize, and was widespread across populations at putatively adaptive loci. In contrast, genomic regions near known domestication and cross-incompatibility loci appeared particularly resistant to introgression in both directions of gene flow. Crop-wild study systems should play an important role in future studies of introgression due to their well-developed genomic resources and histories of reciprocal gene flow during crop expansion.</p>},

@article{fitzpatrick2010rapid,
  abstract = {When introduced or cultivated plants or animals hybridize with their native relatives, the spread of invasive genes into native populations might have biological, aesthetic, and legal implications. Models suggest that the rate of displacement of native by invasive alleles can be rapid and inevitable if they are favored by natural selection. We document the spread of a few introduced genes 90 km into a threatened native species (the California Tiger Salamander) in 60 years. Meanwhile, a majority of genetic markers (65 of 68) show little evidence of spread beyond the region where introductions occurred. Using computer simulations, we found that such a pattern is unlikely to emerge by chance among selectively neutral markers. Therefore, our results imply that natural selection has favored both the movement and fixation of these exceptional invasive alleles. The legal status of introgressed populations (native populations that are slightly genetically modified) is unresolved by the US Endangered Species Act. Our results illustrate that genetic and ecological factors need to be carefully weighed when considering different criteria for protection, because different rules could result in dramatically different geographic areas and numbers of individuals being protected.},

They have adapted to many habitats and climates, and their populations provide a rich source of opportunities for studying the impact of adaptation and positive selection on the genome. By scanning the whole genome of four natural populations of mice, we detect abundant evidence for recent positive selection, including loci that are known to be involved in genetic diseases in humans. Unexpectedly, we also find a high proportion of gene exchange between populations that have long been separated. This finding supports the notion that hybridization and transfer of alleles can significantly contribute to new genetic material subject to positive selection.},

Evidence of interactions between natural selection and genetic linkage is abundant not only in centromere- and telomere-proximal regions, but also throughout the euchromatic arms. Linkage disequilibrium, which decays within 1 kbp, exhibits a strong bias toward coupling of the more frequent alleles and provides a high-resolution map of recombination rate. The juxtaposition of population genetics statistics in small genomic windows with gene structures and chromatin states yields a rich, high-resolution annotation, including the following: (1) 5'- and 3'-UTRs are enriched for regions of reduced polymorphism relative to lineage-specific divergence; (2) exons overlap with windows of excess relative polymorphism; (3) epigenetic marks associated with active transcription initiation sites overlap with regions of reduced relative polymorphism and relatively reduced estimates of the rate of recombination; (4) the rate of adaptive nonsynonymous fixation increases with the rate of crossing over per base pair; and (5) both duplications and deletions are enriched near origins of replication and their density correlates negatively with the rate of crossing over. Available demographic models of X and autosome descent cannot account for the increased divergence on the X and loss of diversity associated with the out-of-Africa migration. Comparison of the variation among these genomes to variation among genomes from D. simulans suggests that many targets of directional selection are shared between these species.},

The advantages of the mixed-linear-model association (MLMA) method include the prevention of false positive associations due to population or relatedness structure and an increase in power obtained through the application of a correction that is specific to this structure. An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These advances provide researchers applying MLMA methods with many options to choose from, but we caution that MLMA methods are still subject to potential pitfalls.

Quantitative expectations for these patterns, however, have not been obtained. Here, we develop coalescent models of neutral sites linked to an inversion polymorphism in two locally adapted populations. We consider two scenarios of local adaptation: selection on the inversion breakpoints and selection on alleles inside the inversion. We find that ancient inversion polymorphisms cause genetic diversity to depart dramatically from neutral expectations. Other situations, however, lead to patterns that may be difficult to detect; important determinants are the age of the inversion and the rate of gene flux between arrangements. We also study inversions under genetic drift, finding that they produce patterns similar to locally adapted inversions of intermediate age. Our results are consistent with empirical observations, and provide the foundation for quantitative analyses of the roles that inversions have played in speciation.},

Indeed, inversions seem to be nearly ubiquitous, and the majority of species that have been thoroughly surveyed have been found to
be polymorphic for one or more chromosomal inversions. Despite enduring interest, however, inversions remain difficult to study
because their effects are often cryptic, and few efficient assays have been developed. Even in Drosophila melanogaster, in which
inversions can be reliably detected and have received considerable attention, the breakpoints of only three inversions have been
characterized molecularly. Hence, inversion detection and assay design remain important unsolved problems. Here, we present
a method for identification and local de novo assembly of inversion breakpoints using next-generation paired-end reads derived from
D. melanogaster isofemale lines. PCR and cytological confirmations demonstrate that our method can reliably assemble inversion
breakpoints, providing tools for future research on D. melanogaster inversions as well as a framework for detection and assay design of
inversions and other chromosome aberrations in diverse taxa.},

@article{charlesworth1993effect,
  abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount
of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in
a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious
alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate
formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background
selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations,
nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating
populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or
by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential
function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved.
Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of
outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating
neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population
size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies
at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical
neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of
sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in
highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious
mutations.},

  abstract = {The mutation process continually produces new deleterious variants at sites throughout the genome, which are then mostly eliminated by selection. This causes a reduction in variability at linked neutral or nearly neutral sites, as well as distortions of the genealogies of samples of alleles from a population. In regions of the genome where recombination is frequent, the effects of selection against deleterious mutations on variability and evolution at linked sites can be predicted under the assumption that most deleterious mutations have such large effects that their behavior in the population is effectively deterministic—this is background selection in the strict sense. But in genomic regions with little or no recombination, such as the Y chromosome, large departures from the predictions using deterministic models may occur, because of interference between different sites under selection. Evidence from Drosophila and human populations is discussed, which suggests that these processes play a major role in shaping patterns of DNA sequence variation and evolution, including the relative levels of variation on X chromosomes and autosomes, and the highly reduced variability seen in regions that lack crossing over.},

  abstract = {Approximately 2–4\% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred
with anatomically modern humans. Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic
regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles.
However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that
Neanderthals had at least 40\% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal
introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-
Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5\%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on
mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the
Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious
alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other
species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.},

  abstract = {Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans. After hybridization, on average, selection appears to have removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. Quantifying the strength and causes of this selection against Neanderthal ancestry is key to understanding our relationship to Neanderthals and, more broadly, how populations remain distinct after secondary contact. Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral---and segregating at high frequency---in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. While individually of small effect, these alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on the early-generation human--Neanderthal hybrids. This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.},

@article{kim2002hitchhiking,
  abstract = {The theory of genetic hitchhiking predicts that the level of genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong directional selection and increases as the recombinational distance from the site of selection increases. This characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event. This method also allows us to estimate the strength and the location of directional selection from DNA sequence data.

  abstract = {Medicago truncatula is a model for investigating legume genetics, including the genetics and evolution of legume–rhizobia symbiosis. We used whole-genome sequence data to identify and characterize sequence polymorphisms and linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a diverse collection of 26 M. truncatula accessions. Our analyses reveal that M. truncatula harbors both higher diversity and less LD than soybean (Glycine max) and exhibits patterns of LD and recombination similar to Arabidopsis thaliana. The population-scaled recombination rate is approximately one-third of the mutation rate, consistent with expectations for a species with a high selfing rate. Linkage disequilibrium, however, is not extensive, and therefore, the low recombination rate is likely not a major constraint to adaptation. Nucleotide diversity in 100-kb windows was negatively correlated with gene density, which is expected if diversity is shaped by selection acting against slightly deleterious mutations. Among putative coding regions, members of four gene families harbor significantly higher diversity than the genome-wide average. Three of these families are involved in resistance against pathogens; one of these families, the nodule-specific, cysteine-rich gene family, is specific to the galegoid legumes and is involved in control of rhizobial differentiation. The more than 3 million SNPs that we detected, approximately one-half of which are present in more than one accession, are a valuable resource for genome-wide association mapping of genes responsible for phenotypic diversity in legumes, especially traits associated with symbiosis and nodulation.},

  abstract = {Recombination rates vary across the genome and in many species show significant relationships with several genomic features, including distance to the centromere, gene density, and GC content. Studies of fine-scale recombination rates have also revealed that in several species, there are recombination hotspots, that is, short regions with recombination rates 10–100 greater than those in surrounding regions. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome resequence data from 26 accessions of the model legume Medicago truncatula to gain insight into the genomic features that are related to high- and low-recombination rates and recombination hotspots at 1 kb scales. We found that high-recombination regions (1-kb windows among those in the highest 5% of the distribution) on all three chromosomes were significantly closer to the centromere, had higher gene density, and lower GC content than low-recombination windows. High-recombination windows are also significantly overrepresented among some gene functional categories—most strongly NB–ARC and LRR genes, both of which are important in plant defense against pathogens. Similar to high-recombination windows, recombination hotspots (1-kb windows with significantly higher recombination than the surrounding region) are significantly nearer to the centromere than nonhotspot windows. By contrast, we detected no difference in gene density or GC content between hotspot and nonhotspot windows. Using linear model wavelet analysis to examine the relationship between recombination and genomic features across multiple spatial scales, we find a significant negative correlation with distance to the centromere across scales up to 512 kb, whereas gene density and GC content show significantly positive and negative correlations, respectively, only up to 64 kb. Correlations between recombination and genomic features, particularly gene density and polymorphism, suggest that they are scale dependent and need to be assessed at scales relevant to the evolution of those features.},

  abstract = {... It has probably occurred to the reader that the coefficientof inbreeding may mean very different
things in different cases. (1) There may be divisionof the population into completely isolated small
strains, within each of which there is random mating. The inbreeding coefficient of individuals
relative to the total is here due merely to the relationship of all members of the same strain and
disappears at once with random mating among strains. (2) There may be fiwquent mating of close
relatives but no permanent separation of strains. Here again random mating at once reduces the
inbreeding coefficient to zero. (3) The sires used may be rather limited in number and derived from
even more limited numbers of grandsires and great-grmdsires. In this cam there may be little
apparent close inbreeding at any time, contrary to (2), and no division into strains, contrary to (l),
but the value of F, relative to the foundation stock, keeps rising and cannot be much reduced by
random mating. There are other possibilities. Clearly we need something more than a single
value of F to give an adequate description of structure.},

@article{huertasnchez2013genetic,
  abstract = {The Tibetan and Andean Plateaus and Ethiopian highlands are the largest regions to have long-term high-altitude residents. Such populations are exposed to lower barometric pressures and hence atmospheric partial pressures of oxygen. Such “hypobaric hypoxia” may limit physical functional capacity, reproductive health, and even survival. As such, selection of genetic variants advantageous to hypoxic adaptation is likely to have occurred. Identifying signatures of such selection is likely to help understanding of hypoxic adaptive processes. Here, we seek evidence of such positive selection using five Ethiopian populations, three of which are from high-altitude areas in Ethiopia. As these populations may have been recipients of Eurasian gene flow, we correct for this admixture. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype data from multiple populations, we find the strongest signal of selection in BHLHE41 (also known as DEC2 or SHARP1). Remarkably, a major role of this gene is regulation of the same hypoxia response pathway on which selection has most strikingly been observed in both Tibetan and Andean populations. Because it is also an important player in the circadian rhythm pathway, BHLHE41 might also provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the recognized impacts of hypoxia on the circadian clock. These results support the view that Ethiopian, Andean, and Tibetan populations living at high altitude have adapted to hypoxia differently, with convergent evolution affecting different genes from the same pathway.},

@article{martin2016natural,
  abstract = {A combination of selective and neutral evolutionary forces shape patterns of genetic diversity in nature. Among the insects, most previous analyses of the roles of drift and selection in shaping variation across the genome have focused on the genus Drosophila. A more complete understanding of these forces will come from analysing other taxa that differ in population demography and other aspects of biology. We have analysed diversity and signatures of selection in the neotropical Heliconius butterflies using resequenced genomes from 58 wild-caught individuals of H. melpomene, and another 21 resequenced genomes representing 11 related species. By comparing intra-specific diversity and inter-specific divergence, we estimate that 31\% of amino acid substitutions between Heliconius species are adaptive. Diversity at putatively neutral sites is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with recombination rate, indicating widespread linked selection. This process also manifests in significantly reduced diversity on longer chromosomes, consistent with lower recombination rates. Genetic hitchhiking around beneficial non-synonymous mutations has also had a significant impact on genetic variation in this species, but evidence for strong selective sweeps was limited overall. We did however identify two regions where distinct haplotypes have swept in different populations, leading to increased population differentiation. On the whole, our study suggests that positive selection is less pervasive in these butterflies as compared to fruit flies; a fact that curiously results in very similar levels of neutral diversity in these very different insects.},

  abstract = {Recombination rate is a key evolutionary parameter that determines the degree to which sites are linked. Estimating recombination rates is thus of crucial importance for population genetic and molecular evolutionary studies. We present here a user-friendly web-based tool that can be used to retrieve recombination rate estimates for single and/or multiple loci in the Drosophila melanogaster genome given a user-defined choice of the genome release. We used the Marey map approach that is based on comparing the genetic and physical maps to infer recombination rates along the major chromosomes of the D. melanogaster genome. Our implementation of this approach is based on building third-order polynomials which are used to interpolate recombination rates at all points on the chromosome except for telomeric and centromeric regions in which such polynomials are known to provide particularly poor estimation. },

@article{comeron2012many,
  abstract = {Recombination is a fundamental biological process with profound evolutionary implications. Theory predicts that recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations. Yet, direct tests of this prediction have been restricted to qualitative trends due to the lack of detailed characterization of recombination rate variation across genomes and within species. The use of imprecise recombination rates can also skew population genetic analyses designed to assess the presence and mode of selection across genomes. Here we report the first integrated high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination, which also distinguishes between the two outcomes of meiotic recombination: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). We characterized the products of 5,860 female meioses in Drosophila melanogaster by genotyping a total of 139 million informative SNPs and mapped 106,964 recombination events at a resolution down to 2 kilobases. This approach allowed us to generate whole-genome CO and GC maps as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species. We describe many levels of variation in recombination rates. At a large-scale (100 kb), CO rates exhibit extreme and highly punctuated variation along chromosomes, with hot and coldspots. We also show extensive intra-specific variation in CO landscapes that is associated with hotspots at low frequency in our sample. GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. At a local scale, recombination events are associated with numerous sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, thus suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. All these non-independent layers of variation in recombination across genomes and among individuals need to be taken into account in order to obtain relevant estimates of recombination rates, and should be included in a new generation of population genetic models of the interaction between selection and linkage.},
